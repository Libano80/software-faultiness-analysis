# software-faultiness-analysis

## Project Purpose

The purpose of the project is to carry out a complete data analysis using the R programming language.

The analysis is based on the dataset lucene-2.4, also available at:
https://archive.apache.org/dist/lucene/java/. <br>
In particular, the dataset Lucene provides Java-based indexing and search technology, as well as spellchecking, hit highlighting and advanced analysis/tokenization capabilities.

The performed analysis wants to evaluate whether it is possible to build some statistically-significant models starting from the considered dataset.
In particular, the performances of both univariate and multivariate models are evaluated.

The performances of each analyzed model are reported in the corresponding conclusion section.
A brief overview of all the obtained results is reported in the conclusion of the project.
